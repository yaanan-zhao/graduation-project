Deep Learning，Small Object Detection，UAV Aerial View

The detection of vehicles from aerial drone imagery represents a cutting-edge topic in the field of computer vision. In recent years, drones have been widely employed in fields such as traffic monitoring and disaster rescue due to their flexibility and compactness. Real-time vehicle detection from aerial perspectives is a key technology for applications such as vehicle tracking and road condition monitoring. However, the aerial perspective introduces challenges due to complex backgrounds, small targets, and scale variations.
Most existing deep learning detection algorithms utilize the YOLO or R-CNN series, but they still face limitations in capturing small target features in aerial imagery. To address this, this paper proposes a small vehicle detection system for drones based on PP-YOLOE-SOD. The system builds upon the YOLO single-stage detector and has been optimized in several aspects:
1. Data Selection and Preprocessing: Key data from the VisDrone2019 dataset is filtered and undergoes image enhancement to extend color distribution and increase image contrast, providing a foundation for model training.
2. Model Design: Building upon the YOLO series, PP-YOLOE-SOD employs the DFL algorithm to optimize the center prior strategy and incorporates a Transformer module into the model's Neck part. This design enhances the accuracy of small target detection, while the CSPRepResNet structure and RepResBlock modules enable efficient feature extraction and fusion.
3. Model Training and Testing: The model is trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and employs the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) strategy to enhance stability. The application of original image training, 1600-scale training, and sub-image training strategies further improves detection accuracy.
This research demonstrates the promising performance of PP-YOLOE-SOD in vehicle detection from aerial perspectives. Future work may focus on optimizing the model structure, incorporating contextual information, and improving IoU matching to increase model efficiency and accuracy, and to adapt it to a wider range of real-world applications.
